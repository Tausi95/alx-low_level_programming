0x0D - C Preprocessor

This repository contains examples of C preprocessor usage. The code includes several header files defining object-like and function-like macros.
Files

    object_like_macro.h: Header file that defines an object-like macro SIZE with a value of 1024.
    pi.h: Header file that defines an object-like macro PI with a value of 3.14159265359.
    sum.h: Header file that defines a function-like macro SUM that calculates the sum of two values.

Macros
Object-like Macro

    SIZE: This macro is defined with a value of 1024. It can be used to represent a specific size in the code.

Object-like Macro

    PI: This macro is defined with a value of 3.14159265359. It represents the mathematical constant Pi.

Function-like Macro

    SUM(x, y): This macro calculates the sum of two values x and y and returns the result.

Usage

To use the macros defined in the header files, include the respective header files in your C program using the #include directive.
