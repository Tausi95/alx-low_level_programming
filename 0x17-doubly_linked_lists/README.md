# 0x17 Doubly Linked Lists

## Description

This project contains a set of C functions that implement various operations on doubly linked lists. Each function is designed to perform a specific task related to managing and manipulating doubly linked lists.

## List of Functions

1. `print_dlistint` - Print elements of a doubly linked list.
2. `dlistint_len` - Calculate the length of a doubly linked list.
3. `add_dnodeint` - Add a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
4. `add_dnodeint_end` - Add a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
5. `delete_dnodeint_at_index` - Delete a node at a given index from a doubly linked list.
6. `insert_dnodeint_at_index` - Insert a new node at a specified index in a doubly linked list.
7. `free_dlistint` - Free all nodes of a doubly linked list.
8. `get_dnodeint_at_index` - Get the value of a node at a specific index in a doubly linked list.
9. `sum_dlistint` - Calculate the sum of all the values in a doubly linked list.
